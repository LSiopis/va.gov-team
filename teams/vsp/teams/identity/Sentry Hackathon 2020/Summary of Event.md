# Summary of Identity Team Sentry Error Hackathon November 2020

## Intro the overall event and why we wanted to have it
- Lots of noise
- Lack of knowledge about errors by new team members

## Talk about what we did before the event to prepare
- Error buckets and relevance, refer to the individual bucket pages themselves for more details
- Documented access requirements
## Discuss some of the things we did during the event
- Overview of the errors
- Mapped out how to troubleshoot
- Documented where the code is referenced as well as added to the documentation within the error buckets section
- Blew away the timeline, best thing that could have occurred as everyone was very engaged in the conversation
## Walked away with 4 attack plans, one for each bucket
- Created issues for 2 of the attack plans
- Document 2 here
  - Reduced the noise, making them more actionable. Talk about number of events were errors, and how many are errors now
- Knowledge
  - An understanding of the errors and what we should care about
  - Tasks like these in isolation are mundane and sometimes difficult to tackle alone, with the hackathon we were able to work as a team and focus on single agenda for a 4 hour block. This normally takes a few weeks to get through with other priorities coming into play. Other important factor is that we didn't allow this to consume other priorities time because we only worked on it during the hackathon.
    - Reduced context switching 
## To do:
- Feedback session
- Complete the documentation for the error buckets
- Complete the other two attack plans with issues in GH
- Conduct another hackathon to attack the other two buckets
